*Devon Fox 2022*
### Linux/Mac Build/Run Instructions

* This code was tested/run on Rust 1.57.0.  If using 1.59.0, it has not yet been tested.  You can check version by entering the following at the command-line:

        cargo version

* To run the program, there is a single required command-line argument, being the filename of the wav file to resample. Replace 'filename.wav' with the full path relative to the program folder for the wavfile you wish to use.

        cargo run 'filename.wav'

* This will create a new .wav file at half the sample rate, called 'rfilename.wav'.  

*This program will only accept mono (single channel) wav files.*
